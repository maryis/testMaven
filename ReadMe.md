maven project structure:
	src/main/java  (we can change default path in pom.xml, but it is not recommended
	src/main/resources (META-INF,properties,...)
	src/test/java
	src/test/resources
	WEB-Inf/lib or (web/WEB-INF,lib,pages)

in Intellij:
there is maven tab on right
there u can run a command or resolve a dependency
ctrl+b on artifact-name in pom to go to its pom
right click on pom--> maven --> show effective pom

maven lifeCycle(commands  +  clean ):
validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
clean

Steps: If you have only the standard maven plugins from the default superpom, adding a dependency will:
download the specified version to your local repository(/user/.m2)
use it to compile
use it to run tests
during packaging, maven copy dependencies(their binary) inside the package

Version Range Specification:
1.0	   x >= 1.0 * The default Maven meaning for 1.0 is everything (,) but with 1.0 recommended.
 Obviously this does n't work for enforcing versions here, so it has been redefined as a minimum version.
(,1.0]	x <= 1.0
(,1.0)	x < 1.0
[1.0]	x == 1.0

mvn tomcat:run
When developing a war project, you usually build your war and deploy it to an installed Tomcat instance. This is time and resources consuming 
and take time to install locally the instance. The run mojo give you the opportunity to save that by simply running your war 
inside an embedded Tomcat instance in your Maven build.

dependency:
when we reimport on the pom.xml, all related jars are downloaded and save in ../user/.m2, and also they would be in projectStructure/Artifact
if we want to have them physically in WEB-INF/lib, we can put them in new path from projectStructure/Artifact

to copy maven deps in web-inf/lib or ...:
In Intellij IDEA, a Web application archive (WAR) is called an artifact. And you can achieve adding libraries automatically by setting the artifact:

Open Project Structure setting window
Navigateï¼šProject Settings --> Artifacts --> **war exploded --> Output Layout --> WEB-INF
Then create a directory named lib under WEB-INF, right click the lib folder, you will see Add Copy of- option.
Select Library Files and add the libraries you want. [Tips: Ctrl + A can work here to add all files]

use -e with maven commands to get more details on errors, for example:
package -e
